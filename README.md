# SnakeGame

The game is inspired by the Nokia Snake Game. It consists of a snake which moves around to collect the food, and as it eats the food its length as well as the score increases by 10. As the snake starts collecting the food, its speed increases by 10x. But if the snake either collides with the boundaries of the frame or the head of the snake collides with the tail of the snake, the game ends. After the game is over, the user is provided with his score and is given the chance to either start to the game again or to quit the game.
